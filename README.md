# THREE.BAS
THREE Buffer Animation System is an extension for [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). It simplifies the workflow of extending the built-in THREE.js materials to include animation logic in the vertex shader.

The standard way of animating objects in THREE.js is to change the values of position, rotation and scale on the CPU and upload the results to the GPU as a transformation matrix. As the number of objects increases, the volume of data sent to the GPU each frame becomes a bottleneck. THREE.BAS works around this issue by storing additional information on the GPU when the geometry is created (using attributes). The animation state is then determined in the vertex shader based on a small number of uniform values.

The two building blocks of this approach are THREE.BufferGeometry and THREE.ShaderMaterial. The geometry is used to store additional attributes. The material contains animation logic inside the shader. Instead of using ShaderMaterial directly, THREE.BAS provides subclasses that duplicate the behavior of THREE.js materials (MeshBasic, MeshPhong and MeshStandard) and an API to inject (animation) logic in specific locations. This way you can make full use of features such as lighting.

While this approach is more cumbersome to work with, it provides a significant performance boost both on desktop and mobile. It has been used in award winning projects such as [Cavalier Challenge](https://cavalierchallenge.com/) and [DS Signature Art](https://ds-signatureart.com/).

## Compatibility
Tested with THREE.js r84. Will likely fail with older versions (r74 and down).

## Usage
Include `dist/bas.js` or `dist/bas.min.js` in your project. A bower package is also available:

    $ bower install three-bas

## Development
This project relies or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for building the source and running the examples.

Run `$ npm install` to install gulp dependencies and `$ gulp` to start the local server. 

The gulpfile includes a task for converting .glsl files to a JavaScript object with strings joined by `\n` in case you want to build your own (reusable) shader chunks.
